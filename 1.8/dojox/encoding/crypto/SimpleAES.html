Chris Veness (CLA signed); adapted for Dojo by Brad Neuberg
(bkn3 AT columbia.edu) and moved to DojoX crypto by Tom Trenka
(ttrenka AT gmail.com).

</p>
<p>A few notes:
1) This algorithm uses a customized version of CBC mode by creating
a nonce, using it as an initialization vector, and storing the
IV as the first portion of the encrypted text.  Because of this, it
is HIGHLY PROBABLE that it will NOT be usable by other AES implementations.
2) All encoding is done in hex format; other encoding formats (such
as base 64) are not supported.
3) The bit depth of the key is hardcoded at 256, despite the ability
of the code to handle all three recommended bit depths.
4) The passed key will be padded (as opposed to enforcing a strict
length) with null bytes.</p>
